			<h2>Testimonies</h2>
			<p>"Embarking on my web development journey has been incredibly exciting. As a beginner, I've marveled at the wonders of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the building blocks of the web.
			With the help of beginner-friendly tutorials, online courses, and supportive coding communities, I've started creating my first websites from scratch.
			Understanding the basics has given me a strong foundation, and I'm enthusiastic about delving deeper into the world of web technologies.
